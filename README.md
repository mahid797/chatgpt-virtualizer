# ChatGPT Virtualizer (personal MV3 extension)
Local-only Chrome extension that collapses/virtualizes long ChatGPT conversations.  
This repo uses TypeScript + tsup (esbuild) and targets MV3 with a module service worker.

## Quick start
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`  (bundles TS)
- Load `dist/` as an **Unpacked extension** in Chrome.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` – watch mode
- `npm run build` – production build
- `npm run clean` – remove `dist/`

## Notes
- Windows 11 + PowerShell oriented scripts.
- No external analytics; personal-use only.

## Features
- Keeps long chats responsive by virtualizing conversation threads on demand.
- Runs entirely on-device; no data leaves your browser profile.
- Ships modern TypeScript output optimized by tsup/esbuild.

## Development workflow
1. `npm run dev` to rebuild on change while iterating on extension files.
2. `npm run typecheck` before committing to ensure the background/service worker stays type-safe.
3. Reload the unpacked extension from `chrome://extensions` after each dist build.

## Project layout
- `src/` – TypeScript sources for background, content, and shared modules.
- `public/manifest.json` – Chrome MV3 manifest (service worker declared here).
- `dist/` – Bundled output generated by tsup (ignored from source control).

## Troubleshooting
- Delete `dist/` with `npm run clean` if stale files appear in Chrome.
- Ensure Chrome is on a recent stable build so MV3 module service workers stay active.
